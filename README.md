# Don’t Be a Sheep

I’m just a random person on the internet. Don’t trust me. Don’t trust anyone by default.
Read, think, check, and decide for yourself.

---

## Why this exists
To share ideas and receipts without the hype. If something works, you’ll see clear steps
to check it. If it doesn’t, I’ll say so. The point isn’t to build a fan club; it’s to
help you build a spine for your own thinking.

---

## Ground rules
- **No heroes.** Do not put me (or anyone) on a pedestal.
- **No blind following.** If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it yet.
- **Proof over personality.** A nice story is not evidence.
- **Change your mind.** New facts beat old pride.
- **Own your decisions.** You click, you run, you risk—your call.

## How to read this repo
1. **Start with the claim.** What is being said, in one sentence?
2. **Find the proof.** Where’s the data, the steps, and the outcome?
3. **Try to break it.** Look for missing pieces, limits, and counter-examples.
4. **Reproduce it.** Follow the steps. If you can’t, it isn’t proven yet.
5. **Decide.** Keep it, tweak it, or toss it—based on your checks.

If any section lacks enough detail to verify, assume it’s a draft and treat it as such.

## Quick checklist for not being blind
- What exactly is the claim?
- What would count as proof?
- What are the other explanations?
- What’s the worst-case if I’m wrong?
- Who benefits if I believe this?
- Can I reproduce it with clear steps?
- What changes my mind?

Print this list. Use it often.

## How to disagree (please do)
Open an issue with:
- A one-line summary of what you think is wrong.
- A short, clear reason.
- A simple check anyone can run.
- What result would change **your** mind.

Polite > loud. Evidence > vibes.

---

## What I will never do
- Promise outcomes I can’t show.
- Hide steps needed to check results.
- Delete criticism that follows the rules above.

---

## Responsibility
Nothing here tells you what to do. It’s information, not instruction.
Think first. Then act if it still makes sense **to you**.

---

## One last thing
If you’re here for easy answers, you won’t find them. If you’re here to think clearly,
welcome. Bring your own brain.
